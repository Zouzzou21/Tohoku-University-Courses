# COLABS Program Research

This folder contains all the materials and documents related to my COLABS program research at Tohoku University.

- **Purpose:** To organize and manage research materials for the COLABS program.

Feel free to explore the subfolders and files for detailed information and resources.

## Seminar #1

### Questions:

- What is the purpose of the seminars?
    - Presentation of research progress.
- I don't have access to the NAS for the slides, is that normal?
    - Yes, you need to wait until my credentials are created.
- What should I do next (topic selection? how does it work? etc...)
    - No fixed schedule, I come on-site whenever I want (except for the mandatory seminar)
    - I need to discuss with **Omachi sensei** or **Miyazaki sensei** to choose a topic they have for me or that I need to select
    - I don't know if I will be doing seminars
- Who is my reference tutor in case of problems?
    - **Yamamoto Yuriya - 山本 ゆりや**
