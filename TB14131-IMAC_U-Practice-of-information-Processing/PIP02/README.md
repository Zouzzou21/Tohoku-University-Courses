## Lecture 2 Contents
### UNIX Commands and C Programming Review
- Basic commands (e.g., `cd`, `ls`, `mv`, `rm`, etc.)
- Text-based command-line interface (CUI) used for executing programs.
- Terminal in Visual Studio Code (VSC) or Powershell can be used.
  
### C Language Basics
- **Variables & Data Types**: Understanding int, float, char types.
- **Standard I/O Functions**: Using `printf` and `scanf`.
- **Basic Processing Flow**: The concepts of "Sequence", "Selection", and "Iteration" were introduced using flowcharts.
  
### Loops
- Introduction to the `for` loop structure for iterating a set number of times.
- Example code was shown on how to use loops.

### Exercises
1. **Exercise 2-0**: Compile and execute a sample C program using GCC.
2. **Exercise 2-1**: Practice using `scanf` for user input.
3. **Exercise 2-2**: Formatting output with the `printf` function.
4. **Exercise 2-3**: Implementing a simple loop.
5. **Exercise 2-4**: Calculate sums using loops.
6. **Exercise 2-5**: Create a program to calculate factorials.
7. **Exercise 2-6**: Approximate the value of Pi using mathematical functions.

## Programming Concepts
- **Variables**: Declaring, initializing, and working with different data types.
- **Data Types**: Integer, real, and char types, including their memory size and range.
- **Functions**: The basics of `printf` and `scanf`, their formatting specifiers.
  
## From Human Thinking to Computer Programs
- Introduction to flowcharts and Problem Analysis Diagram (PAD) as tools for converting human processes into computer-executable forms.
  
### Upcoming Topics (Next Week)
- Model answers for `for` loops.
- Selection structures (`if`, `else`, `switch`).
- Further exploration of loops (`while`).
- Arrays (Introduction).
