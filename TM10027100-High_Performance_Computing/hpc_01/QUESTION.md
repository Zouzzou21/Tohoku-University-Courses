# Question #1
Let's assume perfect parallelization. Processor A of a single core works at 2GHz with 1.5V, while Processor B of 8 cores works at 500MHz with 0.5V. Those two processors have the same theoretical peak performance. How many times is Processor B more power-efficient than Processor A?

# Question #2
Suppose that 95% of a program is parallelizable but 5% is not. Then, what is the maximum speedup ratio if we have an infinite number of processors?
